# Automate

You have made it to my own personal comfort heaven. Yes, it is still name in progress kind of situation, but you get the point. 

I have had to switch comptures quite often, so that is where this idea emerged. Idea is to write scripts for Linux, Mac, and Windows computers to automate setting up my work station. This first requries me to define what my work station needs are. Currently I have started with visual studio code. 

My aim is to be as versatile as possible. For example with Linux, to make sure that the script automatically check for the Linux flavour and then does all the neccesary steps. Fun right? 

So, keep an eye on my stuff here. I am aiming it to be as fool proof as possible and with as good of a error messages as possible. Work in progess. This is a way for me to learn various scripting skills. Beware world! Lol.
